        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>Graduated in Food Sciences in Guinea and rich in a diverse background in New York, I forged my career on rigor, discipline and adaptability.</p>
        <p>My background testifies to a successful transition between operational safety management (OSH, Food Safety, FDNY) and personal assistance (HHA/PCA). Today, I am taking a new step by integrating Artificial Intelligence into my expertise. My goal is to use AI as a strategic lever to optimize decision-making, automate security and ensure sustainable stability in a constantly changing world.</p>
